## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms.

This Github repository holds all of the files used for my presentation on Sorting Algorithms.

The following is contained:
- /docs, containing all of my findings, and instructions on how to build my demonstration program.
- /presentation, containing all media used for my presentation, along with the mp4 of my presentation video.
- /src, containing all the sorting algorithms shown in the presentation, implemented in C++.

Todo list:
- [x] Create Sorting Algorithm Demonstration Program:
  - [x] Bubble Sort
  - [x] Selection Sort
  - [x] Merge Sort
  - [x] Cocktail Sort
  - [x] Insertion Sort
  - [x] Shell Sort
  - [x] Running Program Loop
- [x] Create Presentation.

## HOW TO RUN CODE ##
Use any C++ compiler (must be standard C++ 17 or over) and build the executable from main.cpp (:
- You can build from the command line with GCC or
- Add the main.cpp file into a new project within Visual Studio and build it with MVSC.
- Use a different compiler than what I mentioned.
